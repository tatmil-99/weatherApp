# \_**\_\_**\_The Weather Page\_**\_\_**\_

This is the well known and overdone weather app that... you guessed it... tells the weather. It does a little more than that though, at least to me. As a bootcamp student, building a project that consumed an API and can then display that data on a page was an excellent way to practice my front end dev skills. Plus, it was cool to understand what goes on behind the scenes when doing something as simple as checking the weather.
